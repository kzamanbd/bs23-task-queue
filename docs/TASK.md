# PHP Developer - Project Task

**Time Duration:** 3 Hours

### Technical Requirements

- PHP 8.2+ with process control extensions (pcntl, posix)
- Pure PHP implementation without external queue systems
- SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL for job storage
- Redis for caching and real-time features (optional)
- Symfony Console for CLI management
- Implement SOLID principles and design patterns
- Use Event-driven architecture for job events
- Follow PSR standards for logging and caching
- Implement comprehensive error handling

### Performance Requirements

- Process 10K+ jobs per minute per worker
- Job dispatch latency under 10ms
- Support 100+ concurrent workers
- Memory usage under 50MB per worker
- Job payload up to 1MB with compression
- Worker startup time under 1 second

### Instructions

- Submit your codebase in a public repository and email the link after completion
- All Git pushes must be within the designated time limit. Exceeding will result in disqualification
- Include CLI tools for queue management and monitoring
- Implement comprehensive test suite including unit, integration and stress tests
- Add performance benchmarks and load testing results
- Create example job classes and workflow demonstrations
- Include deployment guides for production environments
- Document scaling strategies and best practices
- If out of time, prioritize features with lower story points (3-5 pts) first, then medium complexity (8 pts), and finally high complexity (13 pts) features
- Create troubleshooting guides and operational runbooks
- Be honest while accomplishing this assessment. Please be confidential about the assessment
