# Task Queue - Enterprise Job Processing System

## Purpose of this Document

This document focuses on architecture and internal implementation details.

- For installation, usage, CLI reference, and feature overview, see `README.md`.
- This avoids duplication and keeps `README.md` user-focused while `IMPLEMENTATION.md` stays dev-focused.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **JobInterface**: Defines the contract for all jobs
2. **AbstractJob**: Base implementation with common functionality
3. **QueueDriverInterface**: Contract for queue storage implementations
4. **WorkerInterface**: Contract for worker implementations
5. **QueueManager**: Main orchestrator for queue operations

### Design Patterns Used

- **Factory Pattern**: For creating different queue drivers
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different job processing strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: For job lifecycle events
- **Command Pattern**: For CLI operations
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-queue

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Make CLI executable
chmod +x bin/queue
```

> Setup and usage are documented in `README.md`.

## Testing

Testing strategy and commands are covered in `README.md`.

## Configuration

Configuration examples live in `README.md`. This document covers how configuration is applied internally by components.

## Internal Job Types

Supported job modes include synchronous, asynchronous, scheduled, recurring, batched, chained, and parallel execution. See `README.md` for usage examples; this document focuses on how these modes are orchestrated internally via the scheduler, dependency resolver, and worker pool.

## Operational Characteristics

- Throughput and latency characteristics are measured and reported in `PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md` and summarized in `README.md`.
- Internally, performance is driven by priority-aware fetching, batching, and minimized contention in the driver.

## Security Internals

- Payload encryption: AES-256-GCM via `TaskQueue\Support\Encryption` with per-payload IV and auth tag.
- Compression: Automatic for payloads >1KB via `TaskQueue\Support\Compression`.
- Input validation and prepared statements enforced in drivers to prevent injection.
- Memory protection: worker memory watchdog triggers recycling.

## Monitoring & Observability

- Structured logging with Monolog across manager and workers.
- Worker health: heartbeat, PID tracking, memory usage, job throughput.
- Queue statistics: counts by state and priority; performance metrics surfaced via dashboard APIs.

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation under load with backpressure and bounded retries.
- Exponential backoff with jitter; circuit breakers around flaky dependencies.
- Dead-letter retention for inspection and manual intervention.
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGUSR1/2).
- Automatic worker recycling on memory thresholds.

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_queue (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    payload TEXT NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    priority INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 5,
    queue_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default',
    attempts INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    max_attempts INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 3,
    timeout_seconds INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 60,
    delay_seconds INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    dependencies TEXT,
    tags TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    failed_at DATETIME NULL,
    completed_at DATETIME NULL,
    exception TEXT NULL
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_queue_state ON job_queue (queue_name, state);
CREATE INDEX idx_priority ON job_queue (priority);
CREATE INDEX idx_created_at ON job_queue (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_state ON job_queue (state);
```

## Status & Features

High-level status, milestones, and feature summaries are maintained in `README.md`.
